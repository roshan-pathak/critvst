Place the TTF font file you want the plugin to use here.

Recommended (free) font to match Kohinoor Gujarati styling:
- Noto Sans Gujarati — file name suggestion: `NotoSansGujarati-Regular.ttf`

When this file exists, the plugin will attempt to load it at runtime and use it for the title and labels.

If you prefer, supply `KohinoorGujarati.ttf` with the same name instead; otherwise the code falls back to the system font `Kohinoor Gujarati` or a default JUCE font.
